## Selecting

- rear tire gets more beating - go for a more supportive casing to avoid flats
- run a softer compound on the front than the back.

### Combos

|:---------------|:-----------|:---------------|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Cornering      | Excellent  | Excellent      | Good          | Good       | Excellent    |
| Braking        | Excellent  | Excellent      | Good          | Good       | Excellent    |
| Rolling Speed  | Slow (2/5) | Moderate       | Moderate-Fast | Fast (3/5) | Fast (3.5/5) |
| Mud Clearing   | Good       | Good           | Good          | Moderate   | Moderate     |

In summary, the Dissector stands out for its fast-rolling efficiency and excellent cornering in dry and loose conditions, making it a versatile option for both front and rear use[^2][^4]. The Aggressor shares similar
pedaling characteristics with the Dissector and is primarily used as a rear tire for trail and enduro riding. Both offer good performance in dry conditions, with the Dissector providing a bit more versatility across
different terrains.

### Schwalbe Magic Mary

It’s an incredibly popular gravity tyre for DH and enduro riders, and is ideally suited to loose and challenging conditions.

The Magic Mary features a blocky tread pattern with an open design that helps it to shed mud and debris. Heavily reinforced shoulder blocks provide stability under hard cornering loads, and there’s plenty of siping to
help the tyre pinch the ground.

### Schwalbe Big Betty

The Schwalbe Big Betty is a similarly aggressive gravity tyre that’s designed to be run specifically on the rear with a Magic Mary up front.

Wider central blocks help to increase braking traction by providing longer edges for the tyre to grab onto the ground when you’re hard on the anchors. The shoulder tread is also a little shallower and wider to increase
stability when pushing hard into banked turns.

There’s still a decent amount of negative space to help the Big Betty clear mud, and Schwalbe reckons it’s ideally suited to mixed and soft conditions.

### Schwalbe Tacky Chan

Billed as the fastest downhill tyre on earth by Schwalbe, the Tacky Chan is the newest release from the German brand. Developed with input from World Cup racers including Amaury Pierron and Myriam Nicole, the Tacky Chan
is said to be lighter and faster rolling than the Magic Mary and Big Betty, while offering more precision overall.

A shallower tread profile and considerable ramping through the centre blocks helps to decrease rolling resistance, while sturdy shoulder lugs are claimed to be more stable than those found on the Magic Mary, allowing for
more aggressive cornering performance on dusty bikepark-style terrain. You can run the Tacky Chan front and rear, though it can also work as a rear tyre with a Magic Mary up front if you’re riding in looser conditions.

### Schwalbe Hans Dampf

If you’re looking for a faster rolling option for trail and All Mountain riding, the Schwalbe Hans Dampf is the all-rounder of the lineup.

* rounder profile that makes it feel more natural to corner with
* closely-stacked centre tread reduces rolling resistance further over the Tacky Chan
* Alternating blocks on the shoulders are said to provide grip in changeable conditions, though it is more suited to softer soil and dusty trails.

You can run the Hans Dampf front and rear, though it pairs nicely with a Nobby Nic on the rear for a speedy, though still aggressive trail setup.

### Schwalbe Nobby Nic

The Nobby Nic has been in the Schwalbe lineup for what feels like forever. This versatile trail tyre has evolved a lot over that time, and the latest version is easily the best and most predictable yet.

Chunkier edging blocks provide much better stability under cornering, and slightly bigger gaps between the tread help the Nobby Nic to dig through loose surfaces. It’s still a faster rolling tyre than the Hans Dampf
though thanks to the smaller tread blocks, and the staggered array means it remains stable on hardpack trails.
